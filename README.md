Angular, Laravel, CRUD app

This project was created from following a few tutorials, which include Laracast 
and http://angular-tips.com/blog/2014/10/working-with-a-laravel-4-plus-angular-application/ 
and http://scotch.io/bar-talk/quick-tip-using-laravel-blade-with-angularjs
along with - http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/angularjs-and-laravel-finishing-building-a-crm--cms-22234

Also, I want to give thanks to stackoverflow and the http://laravel.io guys for helping me with the issues that I had.

Basically, this is a complete AngularJS/Laravel CRUD app

I have included the songs.sql file so that you may be able to load table into a database called kronus.

If you want to change the name of the database, then be sure to change the configurations within the config/database.php file

If you have set up mcrypt with Laravel and you know the basics of AngularJS, then you can follow the above links, along with 
looking at my code to help you along.

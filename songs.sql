I have added horns in the place of the guitar licks that Lennon recorded.','2012-02-06 18:14:56'),(3,'Achillies last stand','Led Zepplin','As far as length of a song is concerned, this is the longest song that I have recorded. Jimmy Page has four guitar tracks on this song and I have programmed three of the tracks to be played as string instruments.','2012-02-06 18:14:56'),(4,'All along the watchtower','Bob Dylan Jimi Hendrix','Bob Dylan originally wrote and recorded this song, but I am partial to the Jimi Hendrix version. At the same time, I try to sing it like Dylan\'s version with Hendrix mixed in as well.','2012-02-06 18:14:56'),(5,'All my loving','The Beatles','I have always believed that the origins of Punk Rock came from skiffle music. As a result, I played a distorted guitar. Also, I do not have a great enough guitar to play it with distortion, without it resulting in fluctuating volume, which happens when you play a 1980s $350 guitar. Distortion pedals will process the tones and send out a consistent signal.','2012-02-06 18:14:56'),(6,'Amok Time','Gerald Fried','Song number 233 is one of my favorites.

Most of the lyrics are too vulgur for radio play and, as a result, not people know of the American Prayer album released in 1979. These are my three favorite tracks from that album. I had to seek the aide of two musicians Justin Ashouri and his friend to transcribe the Angels and Sailors guitar track.','2012-02-06 18:14:56'),(9,'Anything goes tonight','Guns n Roses','I do not believe that I have a voice that can do justice to Axel Rose. Yet, I have had countless people tell me that I sound like him. Granted, I try to use a voice similar to the voice he used during the verse portions of Its so easy, but the high notes. Sorry, I am not there yet.

Of course, until it is too late. As a result, the guitar track is off timing in some parts, which lead to the vocal track being out of synch as well. I love playing the lead to &quot;Are you experienced&quot; - http://kronusproductions.com/uploads/playMp3.php?mPlaySong=Are-you-experienced.mp3','2012-02-06 18:14:56'),(11,'Atomic Punk','Van Halen','Once again, my guitar does not have the functionality of a top tier guitar. I still love my guitar and do the best that I can with what I have. As a result, it cannot pick up all the subtle movements of the palm of my hand to replicate what Eddie has done on the original.','2012-02-06 18:14:56'),(12,'Avalanches','KRONUS Productions L.L.C.','Thanks to some urging on by my best friend, Carol, whom convinced me before she left her body on April 8th 2011, two days after my birthday, that I should honor my first best friend, Delbert Jones, who passed away when I was 11 years old.<br /><br />After Delbert\'s passing, I received all kinds of inspiration to write all of these songs. However, I did not share them with anyone until it was looking more and more that the time for my best friend was coming to its course. The following songs: Avalanches, Friends and To the One were inspired to me a few months before turning the age of twelve.<br /><br />I would like to thank Carol, for pushing me to finally record these songs. It was 1975, when Delbert left his body.<br /><br />Thanks for being kind to me, when everyone else was so cruel. I would relish seeing you each morning while we would be hall patrol monitors. I still miss that smiling face of yours. Even when some kids would use the &quot;N&quot; word directed at you. You showed me, that what you think of yourself is more important than what others think of you. And everyone knows that I love myself.<br /><br />The big question to me is, why doesn\"t everyone else. I love all of my friends and family. Yeah, basically anyone who loves me. After a suggestion from a friend (Jak Delany), I have re-recorded and remixed. Now you can hear everything more clearly','2012-02-06 18:14:56'),(13,'Back in the day','Music by Rush Lyrics by KRONUS Productions L.L.C.','The music is from Rush\'s song Camera Eye. That music reminds me of the 80s. I learned how to play the lead and used a midi file that I found online, changed some things to fit my situation, followed by recording it. The lyrics were written shortly after the passing of my best friend Carol Ennis. She was more the 80s than the 80s themselves. I miss her and this was my way of honoring her.','2012-02-06 18:14:56'),(14,'Bad Boy','Larry Williams The Beatles','The Beatles recorded many Larry Williams\' songs and you cannot find them in print these days, because of copyright rules. I am old enough to have purchased these tunes when they were in print. This is one of my favorite Larry Williams\' songs. Another song from the skiffle genre, which is the pre-cursor to Punk Rock, which is why I recorded it with distorted guitar.','2012-02-06 18:14:56'),(15,'Barracuda','Heart','Obviously, if I am just beginning to understand how to use my voice, then it will be a while before I am able to sing the likes of songs such as this, but I still love it enough to record it.','2012-02-06 18:14:56'),(16,'Bastille Day','Rush','After recording Carol\'s favorite songs of the songs that I play, this was the second song that I recorded.

He used to play it over and over in the 70s. My late best friend and neighbor, Clyde Johnson, who was a gay jewish man that was always hoping his partner would see the light and settle down with him, but it wasn\'t meant to be. With that said, he had a little part of himself that wished he could be adventurious. Then maybe he would have hit the road with his partner. However, he owned an antique store and wasn\'t about to give everything up for something that might not have lasted. That inspired me to write Bonnie and Clyde. Hope he has someone that will be true to him in Heaven.','2012-02-06 18:14:56'),(25,'Bonnie and Clyde','KRONUS Productions L.L.C.','This was a song that was inspired by my late best friend and neighbor, Clyde Johnson, who was a gay jewish man that was always hoping his partner would see the light and settle down with him, but it wasn\'t meant to be.

I owe a lot of my understanding of music theory to Elton. While I was working a graveyard shift in a parking garage in the late eighties, I basically watched parked cars. As a result of the nature of my position, my boss did not mind if read while sitting in my booth. I chose to study Elton\'s music. I would break down each note in it\'s relation to the key signature, then I would look for patterns. I  did this with many songs, but Elton\'s music was the first.','2012-02-06 18:14:56'),(27,'Bottoms Up','Van Halen','This may be my favorite Van Halen guitar lead.','2012-02-06 18:14:56'),(28,'Cant buy me love','The Beatles','','2012-02-06 18:14:56'),(29,'Castles made of sand','Jimi Hendrix','I found the background guitar midi for this song on the internet.

Greg passing in 94 and his father (Joe) in 97. From 94-97, I hung out with Joe a great deal. We helped each other to get by the passing of Greg. In that time, I met Joe\'s brother (Tony).<br /><br />\n\nGreg, Joe and Tony believed in my musical abilities to the point that it defies logic. Tony gave me two songs that he wanted me to record for him. Both of them have 1930-50s jazz feel. Of course, that was when both Joe and Tony were in their youth.<br /><br />\n\nA little about Joe and Tony in general:<br /><br />\n\nThey grew up at the beginning of the great depression and they had jobs working as runners on Wall Street. They were making 15 bucks a month - whehew - that was good money in those days and the two together - 30 bucks - now you\'re talking - big money.<br /><br />\n\nThey had their own Jalopy and would go to the bars quite often. In those days, only the extremely wealthy could afford to go to bars. As a result, everyone in the bar thought that Joe and Tony were so rich, that didn\'t even know their names. Since they had their own Jalopy and they drank every day, no one questioned that they were men of substance - isn\'t that somethin?<br /><br />\n\nBeing runners on Wall Street back in those days had advantages. They were the first to hear about Pearl Harbor and went to voluntarily enlist. As a result of volunteering and instead of being drafted, they were given jobs as file clerks in the secret service stationed in a small town out in the countryside of Great Britain, where they would fly into occupied France to frequent the brothels. <br /><br />\n\nTalk about a charmed life - these guys missed the great depression and the war for all accounts. They even got their Dad a job working for FDR\'s forrest program. 15 + 15 + 16 (a month) - that family was racking in the cash.<br /><br />\n\nAbout the recording:<br />\nI ask forgiveness for taking so long to get to this and I did tell Tony before he passed (98), that as soon as I have the equipment and the time, then I would be happy to turn his words and music into reality. With a happy tear in my eye, I am happy to say that I have completed one of the two songs - rest in peace - Greg, Joe and Tony.<br /><br />\n\nThis is my first step at early 1900s jazz. Still trying to get the horns to sound the way that I want and I believe I have perfected the drums and bass. Piano is getting there.<br /><br />\n\nNo vocals from me, as I can barely do pop tunes, little alone early 1900s jazz.<br /><br />\n\n<a href=\"http://kronusproductions.com/uploads/4_carol/tony-chobans-smiling-is-worthwhile.mp3\" target=\"_blank\">http://kronusproductions.com/uploads/4_carol/tony-chobans-smiling-is-worthwhile.mp3</a><br /><br />\n\nHere are the words:<br />\nMany songs have been written, in song writing styles,\nLyrics that told us a smile is worthwhile.\nA smile will do wonders for you when you\'re blue,\nYou\'ll feel the difference it will do for you.\nIf all this is true, there\'s no need to think twice,\nAll we need do is smile, to heed their advice.\nTell all your friends to give smiling a trial,\nMake you life fuller, fill it up with a smile.<br /><br />\n\nIf for some reason, you\'re feeling lowdown,\nPut a smile on your face to replace that old frown.\nA smile is contagious, you\'ll agree when you meet,\nOld friends and strangers you pass on the street.\nIt\'s a perfect prescription for you when you\'re sad,\nBreak into a smile, change sad into glad.\nRemember to smile at your work and your play,\nLike an apple a day, it will keep Doc away.<br /><br />','2013-09-04 02:24:00'),(247,'Pink Panther','Henry Mancini Orchestra','Still trying to ease into Jazz and even slow tunes are a bit tricky to me, but I will get the hang of it.

He told me, \"I am going to tell you the same thing that I told Frank Beard back in the 60s. You better be better at music than you are construction.\" That is when our friendship began and his youngest son married my sister and they had my niece, which means they are actually family.<br /><br />Anytime I was feeling like life was too much without my friends and family around, I would call to be reminded that family was still around. I remember crying my ass off, while thinking about my parents leaving their bodies, while also driving on the 101 and luckily traffic was at a dead stop (as usual). I called to speak to Lawson, but he couldn\'t handle the sound of me crying very well and I heard him say, \"Sharon,\" followed by him handing the phone to her. She told me, \"if you give up now, then it will be like all their work was for nothing. They would want you to be happy.\"<br /><br />Instead of feeling sorry for myself, I thought I would record this cover tune for them. I know that they were not big jazz fans, but they used come watch me play at clubs in Houston way back in the 80s. They came to more of my shows then both of my parents combined. While my parents supported me, they did not feel comfortable in places where others consumed alcohol and I respected the principles. <br /><br />Getting a little drunk didn\'t stop Sharon and Lawson from coming &#9786; This recording is for you guys and I hope you enjoy it and I hope you are enjoying the company of your eldest son once more.
